As a user:

<!-- 1 When the app starts, I can see all listings.
 2 I can "favorite" and "unfavorite" a listing on the frontend by clicking the star icon. This feature doesn't need backend      persistence. -->
<!-- 3 I can remove a listing from the page by clicking the trash can icon. This change should be persisted in the backend. -->

<!-- 4 I can search for listings by their name. -->
